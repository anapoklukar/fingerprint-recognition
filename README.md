#### Overview
This assignment, part of the Image Based Biometry class at the University of Ljubljana, focuses on fingerprint recognition using the NIST Biometric Image Software (NBIS). The experiments were conducted on the FVC2004 DB1 B dataset, employing various techniques to analyze fingerprint similarities and quality. The goal was to differentiate between genuine and impostor fingerprints through classification methods.

The GitHub repository contains a PDF of the full report and a Jupyter Notebook with the implementation code.
